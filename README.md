# README
A README about well me:)
My name is Bassam I am Syrian and for some reason just like programming too much.
Im a student in Gems Founders School and in the GitHub student developer programme and thanks to the generous people at GitHub my skills and knowledge and gonna vastly improve.
I am extremely intrested in game development and have made a litte 2d platformer using GDvelop even though its a no code programme it help set the foundations for my understanding in code and if you wanna waste your time the game is on itch.io https://bisokahil.itch.io/a-very-terrrible-game and yes it is a complete asset flip.
I am currently trying to learn C++ and use that to make a game in Unity but this time instead of getting stuck in tutorial hell and learn nothing im just gonna jump in and learn the hard way using lessons as well of coure i need to learn some way or another and thanks to GitHub's student developer programme itll help me in my journey.
I also like messing around with OS for example i just recently downloaded Arch Linux on an old laptop i found in my house that i use from time to time i chose Arch Limuxx as its very complicated and would help my coding skills but at the same time its complications are driving me crazy but it has a nice feeling of freedom.
Im also intreseted in hacking i have no idea why it just seems nice
If i wrote any typos im sorry im focusing more on what to say and for now CYA :)
